# No Synthetic Idle Operations

Do not replace an invalid operation with a fake idle operation. If the operation cannot exist without a required value, move the nullable boundary outward so the operation is only constructed where the value is present.

## Bad Shape

```ts
const initial = useQuery(
  agentSessionId
    ? eden.org({ organizationId })["agent-sessions"]({ agentSessionId }).events.get.queryOptions()
    : { queryKey: ["agent-session-events", organizationId, null], queryFn: skipToken },
);
```

This removed the fake route parameter, but created a fake query instead. The absent state is not a second query contract.

## Why This Is Wrong

- It mixes real generated options with a handmade fallback shape.
- It invents cache keys, operation IDs, noop commands, or placeholder streams that no domain owner defined.
- It makes "not ready" look like a real operation state.
- It spreads nullable handling into the operation layer instead of keeping it at the caller or UI/control-flow boundary.
- It creates future traps when invalidation, refetch, retry, logging, effects, or option reuse treats the fake operation as real.

## Required Direction

- Guard before constructing the operation.
- Split the component, hook, helper, command builder, or worker step so required inputs are non-null inside the operation owner.
- Return a plain idle/not-ready result from your own boundary when needed; do not fake the downstream operation contract.
- Use a library skip/lazy primitive only when it is the library's intended top-level absence API and does not require you to invent fallback keys, commands, paths, payloads, or option objects.
- Keep one operation shape per call site. Do not alternate between a real client-generated contract and a handmade placeholder contract.

## Preferred Shape

```tsx
if (!agentSessionId) {
  return <IdleEventsState />;
}

return <AgentSessionEvents organizationId={organizationId} agentSessionId={agentSessionId} />;
```

Inside `AgentSessionEvents`, `agentSessionId` is real, so the operation can be direct.

## Review Question

Is this code modeling absence in normal control flow, or did it manufacture a fake operation so one call site could stay expression-shaped?
